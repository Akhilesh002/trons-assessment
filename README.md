# trons_assesment

A Flutter project for appointment booking.

## Getting Started

This project is to book appointment. It uses rxDart for data traversal, path_provider for getting path, and image_picker for open phone gallery.

Displayed list items are also clickable. So you can add or modify details like first name, last name & mobile number on this app as well.
